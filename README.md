## ðŸ’» About the project

<p>
This project was made with the objective of learning and practicing more about web development, it was my first time using API and with this project i had acquired experience on how to manage an API,
improve my skills with responsive design and learn the importance of the debounce technic which helped me with my search function.
</p>
<p>
As most projects, i had problems that helped me improve, such as the lack of clean code that gave me a lot of issues, after giving my functions single responsibility it solved and prevented most of those problems.
</p>
<p>
I also had problems with asynchronous code and the usage of git, solving them helped me to understand and improve the usage of them.
